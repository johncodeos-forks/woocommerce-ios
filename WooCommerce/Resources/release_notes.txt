Are you managing multiple stores in the app? Today is your lucky day! Our app now supports push notifications for ALL of your stores connected with the same Jetpack/WordPress.com account, not just the currently selected store.

In-person payments card readers might have firmware software updates – some are super important and are required to be installed immediately. With this release, you can defer the upgrade of the optional updates for a better time.

You’ll also find you can filter the product list by category in this release.
